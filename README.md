Data Structure and Analysis Overview

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________

Introduction:
This repository documents the dataset structure and analysis pipeline for experiments investigating decision-making behavior and neural responses in rhesus macaques during delayed reaching tasks. The study builds upon existing methodologies while incorporating new experimental design elements to address how reward levels, target angles, and task difficulty influence behavioral and neural outcomes.

Background:
The foundational experimental setup involved three adult male rhesus macaques performing delayed center-out reaching tasks. Each monkey interacted with targets under varying conditions while neural data from the primary motor cortex (M1) and dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) were recorded using implanted Utah arrays. Behavioral data, such as reaction times and success rates, were collected alongside neural spike data, providing a comprehensive view of task performance and neural engagement.

***** New Experimental Design *****

Building on these foundational methods, the current study introduces new task parameters to further dissect the role of task difficulty and simplified reward structures in decision-making and neural tuning.

  1. Simplified Reward Structure:

The new setup reduces the reward conditions to three levels: Small, Medium, and Large, removing the Jackpot condition.

  2. Restricted Target Angles:
Instead of multiple target angles, only 70째 and 250째 are used. This ensures a focused analysis of how behavioral and neural responses vary with constrained spatial configurations.

  3. Task Difficulty:
     
Task difficulty is introduced as a new parameter, defined by the radius of the target region:
Difficulty Levels: 10 (hard), 15 (medium), and 30 (easy), where larger radii correspond to lower difficulty.
Difficulty modulates the precision required for successful target acquisition.
  
  4. Condition Combinations:

A 3x3 grid of experimental conditions (Reward x Difficulty) is established. In each trial, two combinations from this grid are presented, one at each target angle (70째 and 250째). This ensures that monkeys encounter varying levels of reward and difficulty simultaneously.

***** Experimental Goals *****
  1. Behavioral Objectives:

Investigate how reward magnitude and task difficulty influence success rates, reaction times, and failure modes.
Examine decision-making strategies when presented with simultaneous conditions.

  2. Neural Objectives:

Analyze the directional tuning and reward modulation of neural firing rates in M1 and PMd during the delay and reach phases.
Evaluate trial-to-trial variability and how neural encoding adapts to task difficulty.

  3. Comparison with Previous Work:

Determine how simplified conditions and added difficulty parameters alter behavioral and neural outcomes compared to the original experiment.
